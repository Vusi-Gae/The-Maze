## Purpose
Our project aims to create an immersive 3D maze game using raycasting technology. By implementing various features such as wall rendering, player movement, and collision detection, we aim to provide an engaging gaming experience.
To make this maze, we used ray-casting to draw the walls and textures to design the game by using the C programming language and the SDL2 library to render and add the textures. The maps are defined in 2D arrays in text files, which are parsed when passed as an argument to the maze executable. 0 represents open space, all other integers are drawn as walls.
## What is Ray-Casting?
Ray-casting is technique that transform a simple form of data into a 3D projection by tracing rays from the view point into the viewing volume.
## About SDL2
Simple DirectMedia Layer is a cross-platform development library designed to provide low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics hardware via OpenGL and Direct3D. It is used by video playback software, emulators, and popular games including Valve's award winning catalog and many Humble Bundle games
